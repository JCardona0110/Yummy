This is a template website I made for my previous restaurant employer as a quick demo to show what can be done to modernize their current website. Using a bootstrap template and making some adjustments and some copywrite, I had something quick to demo for them.

My learning was focused on making a modern site that was an upgrade on their current one which is quite bare bones.

## Optimizations

Were I to actually make make this product for my old employer I would update the photos and change colour profile to go with the restaurants current theme. I would highlight their best parts and make it easy for potential clientele to see what they're all about.
